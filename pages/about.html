          <p>
            Rusty Browns started out smallâ€”like real small, not big or huge or anything like that. Just a small little start, kind of tiny really, in the back of this dry cleaner place where clothes got cleaned. The kitchen area was not clean, but it was there and was a space where donut stuff could happen and be made.

          <p>
           Then, after some time passed and I moved on, things started changing slowly but also a bit quickly. One shop became two, and then more came after those, so the number of shops got bigger over time. We made a system-type of thing, not super perfect but kind of working most of the time, so that more and more people in more places could get donuts from us.

            The idea, or maybe more like the plan or goal we had in mind, was always the same: to make people smile and feel good and happy from eating sweet stuff. Donuts contain sugar. They're fried and hot, and people eat them and feel things that they've never felt before. It's just what it is.
Donuts from Rusty Brown's aren't just food you eat, they're more than just something to chew. It's a food item that is also kind of a moment or a feeling or even maybe a little memory that stays.

           The outside is kinda crunchy but not hard-crunchy, and the inside is soft in a way that's not hard but more like squishy-soft. Some people like them, some people like them a lot, and others like them less, but still maybe kind of like them.
